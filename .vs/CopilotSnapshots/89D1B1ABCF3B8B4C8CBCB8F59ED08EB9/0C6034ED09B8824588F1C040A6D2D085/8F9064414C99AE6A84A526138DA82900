Task 8 Band Welcome ! (7 marks)

Your band has its very first gig! What songs are you going to play?

Write a program that asks for your band name, and then for a 
list of space-separated song titles.

Note: Your band only sings songs with one=word titles!

The output should look like this:
=========================
Band: The One Word Wonders
Songs: Song Lyric Ballad
Please welcome to the stage, The One Word Wonders!
They will be playing...
! Song
! Lyric
! Ballad
Give it up for The One Word Wonders!
========================= 

Here's another example:
=========================
Band: Lady Gaga
Songs: Paparazzi Applause Shallow
Please welcome to the stage, Lady Gaga!
They will be playing...
! Paparazzi
! Applause
! Shallow
Give it up for Lady Gaga!
=========================

HINT: Use "!" as the symbol in front of the songs!
